# Cobat
An open source program that makes Copilot available to anyone



# Guide (CMD)
All you need to do is run the bat/exe file as admin and Copilot will permanently be available on your pc! The exe is flagged as a virus therefore the bat file is recommended. (Cobat is not a virus and completely safe). 

# Guide (No CMD)
All you need to do is run the bat/exe file as admin and Copilot will permanently be available on your pc!
With this version there is no longer a CMD window on startup but it is flagged as a virus. (Cobat is not a virus and completely safe). The bat/exe file will automatically add exclusions for the files needed however it can't do it before you open the file therefore the bat file is recommended. 



# Guide (Old)
Move the Cobat folder into the C drive (Make sure there is no additional folders inside)
Then move the file called Cobat with the copilot logo to wherever you want to start the program from. 
Now just open the file whenever you want to have copilot on your pc. 
Press Win + C to activate



# Please note
The exe is flagged as a virus on windows 11 so just download the bat file if you don't want to deal with windows defender. (It's of course a false positive and Cobat is not a virus or any type of malware). 



# Please note (Old)
Copilot gets removed after restarting the PC so just open the file again. 
The exe is flagged as a virus on windows 11 so just download the batch file if you don't want to deal with windows defender. (It's of course a false positive and Cobat is not a virus or any type of malware)
I am aware there is to many batch files but idc rn and it works. 
(I might change that soon)
