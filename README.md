# Cobat
An open source program that makes Copilot available to anyone



# Guide
All you need to do is run the bat/exe file as admin and Copilot will permanently be available on your pc!
There is no longer a CMD window on startup but it is flagged as a virus. (Cobat is not a virus and completely safe). The bat/exe file will automatically add exclusions for the files needed however it can't do it before you open the file therefore the bat file is recommended. 



# Please note
The exe is flagged as a virus on windows 11 so just download the bat file if you don't want to deal with windows defender. (It's of course a false positive and Cobat is not a virus or any type of malware). 
The **No CMD** files add exclutions for the entire user folder so use those versions at your own risk as it makes it easier for malware to go undetected. 
The only difrence between the exe and bat is that the bat opens a **CMD** window and the exe doesn't (The **No CMD** version of the bat only opens when you run it the first time and the **CMD** exe opens a **CMD** when the PC starts)
