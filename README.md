# Cobat
An open source program that makes Copilot available to anyone



# Guide
1. Download the `cobat.install.bat` from releases and double click to run it. 
2. Press more info then run anyway.
3. Press yes when to pop up appears. 
4. Now just wait until it's done and press any key to finish installing Cobat. 



# Please note
The exe is flagged as a virus on windows 11 so just download the bat file if you don't want to deal with windows defender. (It's of course a false positive and Cobat is not a virus or any type of malware). 
The **No CMD** files add exclutions for the entire user folder so use those versions at your own risk as it makes it easier for malware to go undetected. 
The only difrence between the exe and bat is that the bat opens a **CMD** window and the exe doesn't (The **No CMD** version of the bat only opens when you run it the first time and the **CMD** exe opens a **CMD** when the PC starts)
