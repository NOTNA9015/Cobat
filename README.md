# Cobat
An open source program that makes Copilot available to anyone



# Guide (Source Code)
Move the Cobat folder into the C drive (Make sure there is no additional folders inside)
Then move the file called Cobat with the copilot logo to wherever you want to start the program from. 
Now just open the file whenever you want to have copilot on your pc. 
Press Win + C to activate



# Guide (EXE)
Just open the exe file you downloaded then press Win + C


# Please note 
Copilot gets removed after restarting the PC so just open the file again. 
The exe is flagged as a virus on windows 11 so just download the batch file if you don't want to deal with windows defender. 
I am aware there is to many batch files but idc rn and it works. 
(I might change that soon)
